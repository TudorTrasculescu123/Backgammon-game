# Backgammon-game
## About :thought_balloon:
For my first OOP project in Java I chose the Backgammon game. It was the first time I have worked with JavaFx Framework. It involves two players playing locally against each other until one of them wins or until they decide to reset the game.
## Features :white_check_mark:
- Showing the value of the dice after each roll.
- Checking for unallowed moves that should not be permitted.
- Checking for the impossibility to move in some cases.
- The player has to wait until the other player made all the possible legal moves.
- Treating special cases, like the one when both diece have the same value.
- New game button that also acts like a reset whenever the players want to start a new game.
- The player that takes out all the pieces from the table wins.
